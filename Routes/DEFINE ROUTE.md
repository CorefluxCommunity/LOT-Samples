# KEYWORD: `DEFINE ROUTE`

## 1. Overview

- **Description:**
  Defines configuration routes within the Coreflux MQTT Broker, enabling broker-to-broker communication, data storage integrations, and pipeline management. Routes allow the broker to dynamically manage data flow, internal broker architecture, and external system integrations.

## 2. Signature

- **Syntax:**
  ```lot
  DEFINE ROUTE <route_name> WITH TYPE <route_type>
      ADD <CONFIGURATION_TYPE>
          WITH <configuration_parameters>
      ADD MAPPING <mapping_name>
          WITH SOURCE_TOPIC <source_topic>
          WITH DESTINATION_TOPIC <destination_topic>
          WITH DIRECTION <direction>
  ```

## 4. Route Usage Examples

### 4.1 MQTT Cluster Route (System Route)

Defines a route for MQTT clustering:

```lot
DEFINE ROUTE MqttClusterRoute WITH TYPE MQTT_CLUSTER
    ADD CLUSTER_CONFIG
        WITH BROKER_ADDRESS "127.0.0.1"
        WITH BROKER_PORT '1884'
        WITH CLIENT_ID "ClusterNode1"
        WITH USERNAME "root"
        WITH PASSWORD "coreflux"
        WITH MESSAGE_VALIDITY_SEC '30'
```

### 5.2 Opensearch Route (Data Storage Route)

Integrates MQTT broker with a database like OpenSearch:

```lot
DEFINE ROUTE OpenSearch_Connection WITH TYPE OPENSEARCH
    ADD OPENSEARCH_CONFIG
        WITH BASE_URL "address"
        WITH USERNAME "user"
        WITH PASSWORD "pass"
        WITH USE_SSL "true"
        WITH IGNORE_CERT_ERRORS "false"
```

### 5.3 MQTT Bridge Route (Data Pipeline Route)

Configures MQTT bridge communication:

```lot
DEFINE ROUTE MqttBridgeRoute WITH TYPE MQTT_BRIDGE
    ADD SOURCE_CONFIG
        WITH BROKER SELF
    ADD DESTINATION_CONFIG
        WITH BROKER_ADDRESS "iot.coreflux.cloud"
        WITH BROKER_PORT '1883'
        WITH CLIENT_ID "RemoteClient"
    ADD MAPPING temperature
        WITH SOURCE_TOPIC "room/temp"
        WITH DESTINATION_TOPIC "source/room/temp"
        WITH DIRECTION "out"
```
