### Changed

#### Folder Structure
- `Callable Actions/` → `Topic-Based-Actions/`
- `Time Actions/` → `Time-Based-Actions/`
- `ReceptionModel/` → `Basic-Models/`
- `Multi-ReceptionModel/` → `Model-Inheritance/`

**Rationale:** New names clearly indicate purpose and functionality

#### Core Documentation Files

**`Actions/DEFINE ACTION.md` (v1.0.0)**
- Added comprehensive metadata front-matter
- Reorganized content by action types (Time-Based, Topic-Based, Callable)
- Added Python integration section with examples
- Included future extensions placeholder
- Enhanced examples with Tutorial patterns
- Added cross-references to related documentation

**`Models/DEFINE MODEL.md` (v1.0.0)**
- Complete rewrite explaining three model patterns
- Added JSON reception behavior documentation
- Included singleton vs multi-instance patterns
- Added comprehensive field type documentation
- Enhanced with calculated fields and conditional logic examples
- Clarified COLLAPSED vs WITH TOPIC usage
- Added Python integration examples

**`Routes/DEFINE ROUTE.md`** *(existing, pending update)*
- Will add metadata in next iteration
- Will enhance examples with Tutorial patterns

### Documentation Standards

#### Metadata Format
All documentation files now include:
```markdown
---
title: [Document Title]
category: [Action|Model|Route|Syntax|Python|Example]
version: 1.0.0
last_updated: 2025-10-25
description: [One-line description]
related_tutorials: [Tutorial links]
---
```

#### Content Structure
Standardized layout across all files:
1. Overview
2. Pattern/Syntax definition
3. How It Works
4. Expected MQTT Topics
5. Example Payloads
6. Use Cases
7. Variations
8. Related Patterns

#### Future Extensions
All files include placeholder sections for:
- Python integration examples
- Advanced features
- Planned capabilities
- Compatible with VS Code LOT Notebook syntax

### Documentation Improvements

#### Actions Documentation
- Split into three clear categories: Topic-Based, Time-Based, Python
- Each pattern documented with multiple real-world examples
- Progressive complexity from simple to advanced
- Tutorial-aligned naming and concepts

#### Models Documentation
- Three distinct patterns clearly explained:
  1. Basic Models - automatic data schemas
  2. Action Models - dynamic publishing
  3. Model Inheritance - code reuse
- JSON reception behavior fully documented
- Singleton vs multi-instance clarified
- Type casting and GET JSON usage explained

#### Examples
- Complete system examples showing integration
- Real-world industrial IoT architectures
- Working code ready for deployment
- Testing instructions included

### Tutorial Alignment

All documentation now aligns with Tutorial examples:
- `Tutorial/01-basics/` → Topic-Based and Time-Based Actions
- `Tutorial/03-models/` → Model patterns documentation
- `Tutorial/04-routes/` → Route examples
- `Tutorial/05-python/` → Python integration

### Technical Improvements

#### Better Code Examples
- All examples tested and verified
- Consistent formatting and style
- Inline comments explaining logic
- Expected output documented

#### Enhanced Cross-Referencing
- Internal links between related documents
- Tutorial references in metadata
- Related patterns sections
- Navigation aids throughout

#### Python Integration
- Comprehensive CALL PYTHON documentation
- Error handling patterns
- Performance considerations
- Type casting examples (AS DOUBLE, AS INT, AS STRING, AS BOOL)
- JSON extraction patterns

### Breaking Changes

None. This is a documentation refactoring that:
- Reorganizes existing content
- Adds new documentation
- Maintains backward compatibility with all LOT syntax
- Preserves all existing examples (now better organized)

### Migration Guide

#### For Users of Old Documentation

**Finding Actions:**
- Old: `Callable Actions/` → New: `Topic-Based-Actions/`
