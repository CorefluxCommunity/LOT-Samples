# LOT Samples

![LOT Language of Things](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/67444bdb9c312e239038aa41/678a888460016fcf4a0f13b7_Group%209133.webp)

## Project Overview

The **LOT Samples** repository is a comprehensive collection of demonstrations, tutorials, and sample code for the LOT language. LOT (Language of Things) is a human-readable, domain-specific language for IoT systems that uses near-English syntax to define rules, models, actions, and routes. This project is designed for both new and experienced users of LOT, providing practical examples and patterns for real-world IoT scenarios.

**Version: 1.0.0** | [View Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

For more details on LOT, visit the [LOT Language of Things page](https://www.coreflux.org/lot-language-of-things).

## What is LOT (Language of Things)?

LOT is the SQL of real-time MQTT data. Just as SQL transforms and queries static database records, LOT transforms and processes live MQTT streams in real-time. It eliminates the need for complex middleware by embedding business logic directly into the MQTT broker.

### Core Components

- **[Syntax](Syntax/LOT%20Syntax.md)** - Language keywords and functional operators
