Overview\r\n- **Description:**  \r\n  Represents an MQTT topic within the broker, specifying the address or channel through which data is published or received. Topics organize data streams and facilitate communication between clients and the broker.\r\n\r\n## 2. Signature\r\n- **Syntax:**  \r\n  ```lot\r\n  TOPIC\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## 3. Compatible Keywords\r\nList and description of each KEYWORD that can be used in combination:\r\n- **`SET`**: Assigns a dynamically created topic address to a variable.\r\n- **`PUBLISH TOPIC`**: Publishes data to the specified MQTT topic.\r\n- **`KEEP TOPIC`**: Stores data internally associated with the specified MQTT topic.\r\n- **`GET TOPIC`**: Retrieves data from the specified MQTT topic.\r\n- **`IF`**: Performs conditional logic based on topic data or topic existence.\r\n- **`REPLACE`**: Dynamically modifies topic strings.\r\n\r\n## 4. Return Value\r\n- **Description:**\r\n  Provides the specific MQTT topic address used within an action or model.\r\n\r\n## 5.
